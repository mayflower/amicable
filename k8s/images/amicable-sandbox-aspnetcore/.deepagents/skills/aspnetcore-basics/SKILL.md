# ASP.NET Core Basics

## When To Use
- You are editing the ASP.NET Core template.

## Conventions
- Keep endpoint handlers small and move logic into dedicated classes.
- Prefer typed responses and explicit status codes for API routes.

## Preview
- The sandbox preview runs `dotnet watch run` on port 3000.
