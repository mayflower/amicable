# Sandbox Basics

## When To Use
- You need to remember workspace conventions and default QA commands.

## Checklist
- Run `flutter pub get` before analysis/build if dependencies changed.
- Prefer `flutter analyze` for deterministic QA feedback.
- Use `flutter test` only when tests are present (or explicitly requested).
