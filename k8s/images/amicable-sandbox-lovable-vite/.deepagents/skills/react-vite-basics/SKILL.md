# React + Vite Basics

## When To Use
- You are editing a Lovable Native (React + Vite) project.

## Conventions
- Prefer React function components + hooks.
- Styling: Tailwind first; use existing shadcn/ui components when available.
- Keep changes responsive; test in the iframe preview.

## Common Paths
- `src/` application code
- `src/components/` reusable components
- `src/routes/` (if present) route-level UI
